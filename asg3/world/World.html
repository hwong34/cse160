<!--
This is a tragic story of the mystical, but lonely cat. It's name is Kimmy, and she used to live in a small village
with villagers. The villagers always wondered how old Kimmy was. Little did they know Kimmy was actually immortal. 
All the villagers and Kimmy were playful and kind towards one another. However, this joyful life did not last 
long. It was the Winter night of 1876, where the air quality declined severely. Every villager caught a dreadful
disease, except for the mystical cat. No doctors in the village knew how to cure it. Every day, the number of villagers
slowly died from the sickness. The houses remained intact, with only the mystical cat wandering around, hoping that she 
could enjoy the experiences she once had.
